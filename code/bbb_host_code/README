bbb_host_code
-------------

Author: sb

This directory has the host code that runs on Beaglebone Black (BBB).
The code loads the pru code generated by bbb_pru_code and does
everything else that's needed.


1. Requirements
---------------

1. pru_sdk (tested with checkout on August 29, 2015)
   https://github.com/texane/pru_sdk

   This should be cloned (or symlinked) in the parent directory of bbb_host_code
   and accessible at the path ../pru_sdk/.

2. Result from bbb_pru_code
   https://github.com/ap1/PixeeBel/tree/master/code/bbb_pru_code

   Specifically, after running "make START_ADDR" in bbb_pru_code, the resulting
    a. data.bin
    b. text.bin
    c. START_ADDR
   files are needed in this path for the program to work.

3. PyBBIO-ADC
   Came preinstalled with debian for Beaglebone Black.


2. Compiling
------------

  $ make


3. Running
----------

Run as root.

  # ./run_host.sh
