bbb_pru_code

Author: sb

This directory has the code needed to compile the code that will run on
the PRU. The captures 4 audio channels (AN0--AN3) periodically and 
writes the data into shared memory for consumption by the CPU.

The code, in my setup, was compiled on an x86 machine. The compiler from
TI generates code for the target PRU and needs to be copied to Beaglebone
Black (BBB) for use on the BBB.


1. Requirements
---------------

1. pru_sdk (tested with checkout on August 29, 2015)
   https://github.com/texane/pru_sdk

   This should be cloned (or symlinked) in the parent directory of bbb_pru_code
   and accessible at the path ../pru_sdk/

2. PRU Code Generation Tools (version 2.0.0 Beta 2) from TI
   http://software-dl.ti.com/codegen/non-esd/downloads/beta.htm

   This should be installed (or symlinked) in the parent directory of bbb_pru_code
   and accessible at the path ../pru_2.0.0B2/


2. Setting up Beaglebone Black location
---------------------------------------

For convenience, the "make copy" target is available for copying necessary files
on to the target Beaglebone Black device. "scp" is the method used. Fix the SCP_DST
variable in Makefile before using "make copy".


Compiling
---------

Simply running "make" should compile the code and generate text.bin and data.bin
needed to run on the PRU for capturing 4 analog channels.


Installing
----------

"make copy" copies the files on to the target BBB device.

The next step is to compile the host for BBB which will load the code compiled here
onto the PRU.
